covid-19 virus and patient test software and data structure with java

Our covid-19 patient virus test java software code is getting interesting because you can now test patient status using enumerated symtoms of the patient and also test with blood and fluid test sample result from a clinic testing database using patient_id or any other unique credential such as name etc by the clinic(third-party api) for the patient.This can be done using an api or a legit database connection to the clinic database server.

I have tested the code and it working perfectly using #neatbeans ide so what are you waitng for? fork it on GitHub and play with for a better a experience and dont forget to share with your friends
